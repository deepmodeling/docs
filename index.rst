Third Party Documentations
=========================

Below lists documentations written by third parties.
You might want to write your own documentation to introduce users to one of the softwares in DeepModeling community, or to offer institution-specific information, e.g. by pointing users to local workshops, training opportunities and support.

Feel free to copy and repurpose any content (text, images, videos, etc.) to help support and promote the softwares in DeepModeling community.

We always welcome contributions to this part and to the rest of documentations in the `DeepModeling github repositories <https://github.com/deepmodeling/>`_.
